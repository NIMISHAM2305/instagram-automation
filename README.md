# instagram-automation testing

This script streamlines the process of interacting with Instagram reels by automating several key functions. Upon execution, the script logs into your Instagram account using your provided credentials. Once logged in, it allows you to navigate to any specified Instagram account to view their reels. The script automatically unmutes any muted reel, plays it for a duration of five seconds, and then advances to the next reel, repeating this cycle seamlessly. This automation is designed to save time and enhance the efficiency of browsing Instagram reels.
